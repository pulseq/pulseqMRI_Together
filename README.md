# Pulseq Live Demo at MRI Together 2021

Welcome to the *Pulseq* live demo repository! This repository contain all supplementary materials and links to raw data necessary to fully appreciate the live Pulseq software demonstration and hands-on session at **07:15 UTC on Wednesday December 15, 2021**. 

## Quick links

Pulseq Matlab repository:  
https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq

Dropbox link to the measured data and sequences (viewing only):  
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i7f1gpwyigdugps/AACd2jQJg_WjoTY2nqh7O8IHa?dl=0

Upload Dropbox link for Pulseq files generated by the attendees:

## How to prepare

Please consider checking out the main *Pulseq* repository at https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq and familarizing yourself with the code, example sequences and reconstructon scripts (see 
[pulseq/matlab/demoSeq](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq/tree/master/matlab/demoSeq) and [pulseq/matlab/demoRecon](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq/tree/master/matlab/demoRecon)). If you already use Pulseq, consider updating to the current version (1.4.0), which was released several days ago.

[Handout materials](Handout_Pulseq_demo_MriTogether.pdf) to accompany the session are now available in the PDF format containing the slides from the presentation with some additional material and explanations. In particular, the second part of the document (page 18 and on) describe the code examples. Please keep in mind that these examples were specifically developed for the demo, so you might find some useful information there even if you are familiar with the previous versions of Pulseq. 

Source code of the demo sequences and reconstruction scripts is the core of this repository. Please download the files to your computer and make them available to Matlab (e.g. by saving them in a subdirectory inside your Pulseq-Matlab installation and adding them to the Matlab's path). Yhere are two sub-directories:

* seq : contains example pulse sequences specifically prepared for this demo
* recon : contains the reconstruction scripts tested with the above sequences

The raw MR data, sequences in Pulseq format and examples of the reconstructed images can be accessed via the anonymous Dropbox link https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i7f1gpwyigdugps/AACd2jQJg_WjoTY2nqh7O8IHa?dl=0 

The Dropbox repository entails following subdirectories:

* dataLive : data and sequences generated during the session 
* dataPrerecorded : data and sequence examples generated prior to the session 
* upload : sequences and other files contributed by the session participants

The raw data recorded during the session will be shared in real time. You are welcome to pull the data and experiment with them on your own. 

If you would like your sequence tested in IDEA simulator or on the scanner (Siemens Prisma Fit), please upload your Pulseq files using the following Dropbox link: 
https://www.dropbox.com/request/JXkmDIQPgsletXkOgg1u Please make sure to give your files unique and identifiable names.

If you have any questions with regard to accessing the meeting materials do not hesitate to contact us directly. Alternatively you are welcome to post your questions in the session chat. 

**See you at the live demo!**
